This is a test branch which designed for me to better understanding the git hub
# Analyze-script
Analyze script for simulation data
This folder contain 2 subfolder 'Windows' & 'Linux'
'Linux' folder is the main script folder
Seperate file in the root directory is usable template. For different version of specific analyse scripts, look in to the subfolder.
The most analyse script consist 3 parts: Go through each folder, trajectory analysis, output.
Future possible branches:
1. Using the bash scripts to go through each directory and remove the go through part from the script.
2. Build functions for each script, make the script function based.
